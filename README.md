# Parkvision

Web application that is made to illustrate the functionality of a smart parking system, where the data would be substracted from cameras supervision outdoor parking spots using Computer Vision and AI to calculate the percantage of free parking slots.

### Functionalities:
- Users can input data such as the time of leave and the parking place they are in, so that other users can have an idea of when a specific parking slot could be available.
- Every parking lot information is taken from a camera mounted on a post with vision over the entire space.

### Technologies being used:
- Flutter Dart 
- Firebase Hosting
- OpenCV
- Python

### What would be next:
- Connecting the camera(s) output to a database
- Increasing the number of cameras and locations
- Implement a better Computer Vision Algorithm that manages to recognize the cars and parking slots more efficiently
